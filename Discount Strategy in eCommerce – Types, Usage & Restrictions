# Case Study: Discount Strategy in eCommerce – Types, Usage & Restrictions

## 1. Problem Statement
An eCommerce platform offered multiple discounts (coupon codes, cart discounts, bank offers, seasonal deals), but there was confusion around:

- When each discount type should be applied  
- Which discounts could be combined  
- Why certain discounts were not applicable  
- Customer complaints about “Coupon not valid” messages  

This led to:
- Poor user experience  
- Revenue leakage from incorrect stacking  
- Operational confusion for marketing and support teams  

A structured discount framework was needed.

---

## 2. Objective
Create a clear discount strategy that:

- Defines types of discounts used in eCommerce  
- Explains when and where each should be applied  
- Prevents invalid discount combinations  
- Protects profit margins  
- Improves customer clarity and trust

## 3. Discount Types & Usage

| Discount Type        | When Used                     | Where Applied        | Purpose                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------- |
| Welcome Discount     | New user signup               | First order only     | Acquire new customers       |
| Coupon Code          | Marketing campaigns           | Checkout page        | Drive conversions           |
| Cart Value Discount  | Above minimum cart value      | Cart level           | Increase AOV                |
| Product Discount     | Specific products             | Product page         | Clear inventory             |

## 4. Why Specific Discounts Are Not Applicable

### A. Profit Protection
Some discounts cannot be combined because:
- Margin becomes negative  
- Already heavily discounted items  
- Vendor-funded vs platform-funded conflict  

**Example:**  
A product with 40% seasonal discount cannot accept an additional 20% coupon.

---

### B. Campaign Rules
Each campaign has its own conditions:
- Minimum cart value required  
- Applicable categories only  
- New users only  
- Payment method restrictions  

**Example:**  
Bank offer only valid on credit cards, not COD.

---

### C. Technical Stacking Logic
Discount engine follows priority rules:

1. Product discount applied first  
2. Cart discount applied next  
3. Coupon applied last  
4. Bank offer applied at payment  

If rules conflict → discount blocked.

---

### D. Vendor Funding Restrictions
Marketplace sellers may:
- Allow platform coupon  
- Reject additional discount  
- Limit discount %  

---

## 5. Implementation Flow

1. User adds product to cart  
2. System checks product-level discount  
3. Cart value evaluated  
4. Coupon entered  
5. Eligibility validated  
6. Payment method selected  
7. Bank/wallet offers applied  
8. Final price calculated  

If conflict detected → show reason message.

---

## 6. UX Messaging Examples

| Scenario | Message |
|---------|--------|
Coupon not valid | “This coupon is not applicable on already discounted items.” |
Cart value low | “Add ₹500 more to unlock this discount.” |
Bank offer invalid | “Valid only on HDFC credit cards.” |
New user only | “This offer is for first-time customers.” |

Clear messaging reduces support tickets.

| Scenario                     | Action                     | Expected Result                           | Status |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Apply coupon on sale item    | Enter coupon code          | Blocked with appropriate message          | Pass   |
| Cart value below limit       | Apply cart discount        | Discount not applied                      | Pass   |
| Bank offer + coupon          | Select both at checkout    | Only eligible discount applied            | Pass   |
| New user coupon reused       | Existing user enters code  | Coupon blocked                            | Pass   |
| Stack multiple coupons       | Apply two coupon codes     | Only one coupon allowed                   | Pass   |
