## Case Study: Preventing Copy–Paste of Credit Card Data on Checkout for Enhanced Security

#1. Problem Statement

Customers entering card details on the checkout page often worry about data misuse, accidental copying, or malicious scripts capturing sensitive information.

Two key risks were identified:
Users could paste card numbers into the card field (risk of stolen data being used quickly).
Users could copy card details after entering them (risk of leakage from shared devices or malware).
This reduced customer trust and raised compliance concerns during internal security reviews.

#2. Objective

Improve checkout security and customer confidence by:
Blocking paste actions into the credit card number field.
Preventing users from copying entered card details from the checkout page.
Aligning with PCI-DSS secure input handling practices.
Communicating visible security measures to increase trust and conversion.

#3. Proposed Solution

A front-end and UX-driven security enhancement was implemented:
A. Input Restrictions
Disable paste into card number, CVV, and expiry fields.
Allow only manual typing with numeric validation.
Mask card number after entry (e.g., **** **** **** 1234).

B. Copy Prevention
Disable copy/cut actions from sensitive fields.
Prevent right-click and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X).
Auto-clear clipboard when leaving checkout page (optional browser-supported feature).

C. Security Messaging

Add message below card field:
“For your safety, copy-paste is disabled on card fields to prevent data misuse.”
Show security badge and tooltip explaining protection measures.

D. Technical Approach
JavaScript event listeners to block paste/copy actions.
Input masking libraries for secure display.
Server-side validation to ensure no injected values.
Logging blocked actions for security analytics.

#4. Implementation Flow

User lands on checkout page.
Card field accepts only manual numeric entry.
Paste attempt → blocked with tooltip message.
Copy attempt → blocked silently or with notification.
Data masked after entry.
Payment processed via secure tokenization gateway.

#5. Test Scenarios (UAT Focus)
Scenario	Action	Expected Result	Status
Paste card number	Ctrl+V into card field	Paste blocked with message	Pass
Copy card number	Ctrl+C after entry	Copy blocked	Pass
Right-click copy	Mouse right-click	Copy option disabled	Pass
Manual entry	Type card number	Accepted and validated	Pass
Mobile paste	Long press paste	Paste blocked	Pass
Accessibility check	Screen reader entry	Still usable securely	Pass

#6. Metrics & Impact

↓ Fraud risk from copied stolen cards
↑ Customer trust perception (via UX feedback)
↑ Checkout completion rate (confidence indicator)
Improved PCI compliance audit readiness
Reduced data leakage risk on shared devices

#7. Challenges

Some users rely on password managers → allowed secure autofill exceptions.
Accessibility considerations required careful handling.
Needed balance between security and usability.

#8. Final Outcome

The enhancement improved perceived and actual checkout security without impacting conversion.
Customers felt reassured seeing visible protection mechanisms.
Internal security and compliance teams approved the solution as a best-practice UX security control.

#9. Key Takeaways

Small UX security controls can significantly improve trust.
Preventing copy/paste reduces quick fraud attempts.
Security transparency boosts conversions.
Always balance security with usability and accessibility.
Ensure if u have full control of card section able to implement as per needs.
Sometimes it will be control by payment providers in such cases need discussion with them and take decision accordingly.
